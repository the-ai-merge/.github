## The Goal

The AI Merge documents how AI fits into **real software systems**.

The focus is on **end-to-end AI systems** - from models and agents to infrastructure, deployment, monitoring, and long-term operation. This GitHub organization complements the newsletter and courses with concrete implementations, reference code, and system-level examples.

The emphasis is on **building**, **engineering tradeoffs**, and **production realities**.

---

## What You’ll Find Here

- End-to-end AI system walkthroughs  
- Practical agents, vision pipelines, and multimodal systems  
- Infrastructure, inference, and deployment examples  
- MLOps / LLMOps patterns for operating systems in production  

All repositories aim to show how components connect inside a larger system.

> **Note**  
> The work here is informed by real-world experience across AI research, systems engineering, and ML operations.

## Courses & Large Projects

| Project | Description | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| End-to-End Vision Agent System | Full system covering data pipelines, annotation, training, optimization, deployment, monitoring, and operations | Planned |
| Multimodal RAG System | Real-world system using LLMs, vision, retrieval, and LLMOps | Planned |

These projects are designed as **complete systems**, not standalone examples.
